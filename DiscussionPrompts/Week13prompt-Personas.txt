Week 13: Audiences & Personas

The Miaskiewicz & Kozar (2011) article provides some background on the advantages of using personas in product design, and you can think of most information presentations as a type of "product" that needs to be designed to address a specific audience.The related concept of "scenarios" (Links to an external site.) provides detailed stories of how a persona uses a product to achieve specific goals.

With this in mind, pick one of the two prompts to respond to:

1. If you have used personas and scenarios in industry, how were they developed and used? Give an example from your experience.

2. What details are important to include in a persona's narrative? What sources of information might you take into consideration when designing the persona? If you were provided a persona to guide the development of your project presentation, what information do you think would be most useful for making decisions?
