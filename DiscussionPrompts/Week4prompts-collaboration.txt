Week 4 Discussion: Collaboration in Practice

The two readings for Week 4 present complementary views of collaboration principles and challenges: Kotlarsky & Oshri (2005) emphasize the value of social aspects of collaboration, while Dabbish et al. (2012) identify ways that GitHub's social features help ease the challenges of distributed work.

This week's posts should focus on the following questions (try to touch on at least 2 of them):

    Are INFM 600 project teams more like collocated teams, distributed teams, or some kind of hybrid? Why?
    What strategies could INFM 600 project teams implement to improve social ties and knowledge sharing? (feel free to get creative here!)
    How could you take advantage of transparency, visibility, and notifications in GitHub to have a smoother team project experience? There are a lot of great examples of GitHub being used for non-code collaboration; does the focus on code versus some other product make a difference?

Note that you can weave your ideas into replies to others' comments: the more that this resembles a real discussion as opposed to a set of essays, the more we can get out of it (but do address the key points in the prompts!)
