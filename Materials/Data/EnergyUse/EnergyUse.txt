Average monthly household energy consumption by state

Tell them what column headers file will have; step 2 might belong before step 1

1. What factors might influence energy consumption? Probe for: temperatures (seasonal/range), gas usage, daylight hours, average home size, average income

Show map of US

...also geography, what aspects of it? Population density, urbanization, geological features, energy sources

2. Given column headers, think-pair-share on hypotheses to test: price/use, population/price, etc. For each, how should we test it? How should we graph it? What data/source would help triangulate it?

3. What do we predict will be the region/state with the highest cost per kWh, lowest cost per kWh, highest usage, lowest usage, highest bill, lowest bill? Polling tool would be great for this. 

Break students into groups; each group must answer all of part 3 (sorting in Excel)

Then each group gets assigned a combo of testable hypothesis, how to graph data, can also use stats but focus on obvious trends & outliers. 

4. What other data would we need to better understand the results? Where would we look for that data? What query or source should we consult?

Make into spreadsheet. 

5. For India, what states do you think have lowest & highest household energy use & why?

Show students data sources, explain queries used to find them, discuss how to create comparable spreadsheet from them.

6. Repeat steps 2-3 with India data. 

7. Compare the sets of results. Which country has more variability in energy use? Which costs more? What other data would we need for a good comparison of US & India electricity consumption? (e.g., rural vs urban populations, rates of electrification, policies on pricing and who provides electricity, income levels (cost scaled as percent of income), sources)

8. Perfect world: groups of students do a homework to find the data for assigned comparison questions, do comparisons, and share results.
