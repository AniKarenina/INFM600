Where do you call "home"? I.e., your hometown, where you grew up, or the last place you lived before here.

What was (is) your main occupation before starting (or other than) as a student at UMD?

What prior degree(s) do you have? For example, BS, Computer Science; BA, Communication; MLS, Library Science, etc.

INFM 600 Information Environments will explore various models and methodologies used to capture and deploy internal and external information and knowledge in a number of settings.

Students will analyze organizations in terms of information creation, flow, sharing, conservation, and application to problem solving. The course will take into account both internal and external influences on the management of information and knowledge. We will also examine how information flows and is managed in a variety of settings, and examine a number of examples of successful and unsuccessful information management.

Given the course description and your goals for being in the MIM program, what are the main things you'd like to get out of this course?

As your professor, what kinds of things could I do to help you better learn the course concepts?

Are there any special topics or issues related to information management that you'd like to see covered this semester? (I'll ask for suggestions again around mid-semester, so if you're not sure now, that's OK.)

Is there anything else you think I should know as we start the semester?
