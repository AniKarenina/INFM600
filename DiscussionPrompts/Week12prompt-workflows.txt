Week 12: Workflow Management Systems Discussion Prompt

The article on WFMS is a little over 20 years old, and in that time, some things have changed in meaningful ways while others haven't.

Identify one current tool or system that can be used for workflow management, and tell us:
1. What it is & how it can be used for workflow management,
2. Whether it's more likely to be part of an ad hoc, administrative, or production system,
3. Whether it suffers from the limitations on WFMS that the article highlights,
4. How well it compares on the criteria listed in Appendix B (no need to list everything - just note where it's meaningfully different, and ignore OMG CORBA).
