Week 11 Discussion Prompt

Find a data visualization that you find interesting (and that someone else hasn't already posted!) and embed it into your post.

In ~1 paragraph, analyze what it does right and wrong, and call out specific details that are examples of specific concepts from at least one of the week's readings (include the citation/s for the appropriate article/s).

+0.5 points if you effectively incorporate concepts from multiple articles, where each article highlights different aspects of visualization (i.e., not both making the same point).
